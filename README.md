## App Brainstorming
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
1. Instagram - share pics and live feed video w/friends
2. Discord - Community building around a common interest
3. Keelo - a fitness app with short 30-45 min WOD style workouts

Example App: Instagram
Changing the background color of the messages screen
Deleting old messages

 Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
